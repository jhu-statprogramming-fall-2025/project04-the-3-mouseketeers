## What this site is
This website hosts our final project dashboard (DCLP3 glycemic control prediction), including:

- Cohort-level summaries
- Patient-level exploration
- ML model results (AUC)
- Downloadable / viewable tables

## How to regenerate
1. Run the pipeline locally (creates `output/tables/` outputs and `output/figures/`).
2. Render the website:
   - `quarto render`
3. Commit/push the `docs/` folder for GitHub Pages.
